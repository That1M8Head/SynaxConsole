### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
Synax Console is in **very** early stages of development.
## About
Synax Console is a work-in-progress command shell written in C for Windows, macOS and Linux. It can be considered an updated version of [SpeedStriker Utility](https://github.com/That1M8Head/syn4win-old). (renamed to Synax Console for Windows, but the actual code was not changed to reflect this)
